CreatureDraw can use your camera, gallary and storage to enable the save and custom wallpaper features, I don't collect anything provided to CreatureDraw as it's completely offline, If you don't think CreatureDraw is trustworthy, Just deny the permissions and most of CreatureDraw's features will work just fine.
